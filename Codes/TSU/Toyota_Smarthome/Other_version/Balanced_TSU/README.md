# Balanced TSU

The Blanaced TSU annotation is given in `unsynchronised_balance_data_annotation.json`. This is a version of data that overlooks the fine-grained details. This version of dataset is more balanced in terms of the number of samples, with slightly less number of classes (in total 34 activity classes).

We provide a simple baseline for this version of dataset. The architecture/backbone used is a single stream TCN network.
